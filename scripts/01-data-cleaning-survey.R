#### Preamble ####
# Purpose: The purpose of this code is to prepare and clean the Nationscape Data Set downloaded from 
# the Democracy Fund Voter Study Group. Because we aren't looking at each and every one of the more than 
# 200 variables included in the dataset, we want to clean the dataset so that it only includes variables 
# that we are interested in. To address this issue, we only included the variables that we are interested 
# in. Also, in our analysis, we will only be looking at who is going to win the popular vote between 
# Donald Trump and Joe Biden, therefore we cleaned the results so that they only showcase those who are 
# willing to vote for Donald Trump or Joe Biden.

# Pre-requisites: 
 ## 1. Go to: https://www.voterstudygroup.org/publication/nationscape-data-set
 ## 2. Look for the ‘Download the Full Data Set’ heading and enter your information and submit your request. 
 ## After a short period of time, you will have received an email containing links to the dataset. 
 ## 3. Click on the link included in the email. Under the header ‘Download Resources’, download the .dta. 
 ## files. This will be a zip file, therefore you will have to unzip it.
 ## 4. After unzipping the file, open ‘phase_2_v20200814’ -> ‘ns20200625’ -> ’01-data_cleaning-survey.R’. 
 ## We open the folder pertaining to ‘ns20200625’ because we want data from June 25th, 2020. 
 ## 5. We want to then open ’01-data_cleaning-survey.R’ in R that way we can filter the dataset to our needs. 
 ## 6. You may need to adjust the file paths depending on your system.

# Keeping important variables

# After the key is made use the recode function to create a new string based on the collumn being changed 
race_ethnicity0 <- recode(tbdata$race_ethnicity, !!!recode_key)

# Adjust the actual collumn in the data set 
tbdata <- tbdata %>% 
  mutate(
    race_ethnicity = race_ethnicity0

write_csv(tbdata, "outputs/clean-survey.csv")


#### What else???? ####
# Maybe make some age-groups?
# Maybe check the values?
# Is vote a binary? If not, what are you going to do?


# The vote is not a binary variable, it contains 758 "Don't Know", 2626 "Donald Trump", 3075 "Joe Biden" and 20 NAs. 
# We resolved this by deleting the "Don't know" and NA responses, since it was a relatively small (12%) part of our
# data set.
